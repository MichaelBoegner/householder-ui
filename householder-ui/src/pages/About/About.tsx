      <p>
        I realized long after starting to study and practice Buddhism that being a monk is not a prerequisite to enlightenment. 
        In all the various flavors of Buddhism, being a householder is just another path towards liberation, albeit a 
        much more difficult one, given the fog of attatchments that obstruct a lay person's life. <br />
        <br />
        As a result, this site is dedicated to becoming a virtual monestary for the householder, the urban monk, one who is 
        not yet able to go forth into the life of renunciation. I hope it helps to build your understanding of the path and 
        provide you some shelter from the storm, until you are able to shelter yourself, whoever that may be.
